// Config is the configuration for the query service.
// To reduce the applied workload on the database and improve performance we batch views and queries.
// That is, views with the same protoqueryservice.ViewParameters will be batched together
// if they created within the ViewAggregationWindow. But no more than MaxAggregatedViews can be
// batched together.
// Queries from the same view and namespace will be batched together.
// A query batch is ready to be submitted if it has more keys than
// MinBatchKeys, or the batch has waited more than MaxBatchWait.
// Once a batch is ready, it is submitted as soon as there is a connection available,
// up the maximal number of connections defined in the Database configuration.
// Thus, a batch query can wait longer than MaxBatchWait if we don't have available connection.
// To avoid dangling views, a view is limited to a period of MaxViewTimeout.
// MaxViewTimeout includes the time it takes to execute the last query in the view.
// That is, if a query is executed while the timeout is expired, the query will be aborted.
// The number of parallel active views is theoretically unlimited as multiple views can be aggregated
// together. However, the number of active batched views is limited by the maximal
// number of database connections.
// Setting the maximal database connections higher than the following, ensures enough available connections.
// (MaxViewTimeout / ViewAggregationWindow) * <number-of-used-view-configuration-permutations>
// If there are no more available connections, queries will wait until such connection is available.
